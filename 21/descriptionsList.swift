Plus you can chat with your friends if they are using Windows 10 or XBox platforms\n\n* Microsoft Office 365 now supports touch interface on phones, tablets and computers with touch screens",
                                  "Manufacturer": "MacOS\nMacOS is made by Apple Incs and was released in 2001. Apple is a technology company that is known for its products such as the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Mac computers, iPod, Mackintosh and many more. It is based in Cupertino California. Apple is currently worth over a trillion dollars making it one of the richest companies in the world. Apple was started by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne. Steve Jobs was the visionary of Apple while Steve Wozniak was the genius behind Apple who was executing Steve Jobs' vision. Ronald Wayne unfortunately backed out of Apple because the 2 Steves were young and poor while Wayne had some money. He was scared that he would have a financial burden since he's the only one to have some money so he decided to leave which could be the biggest mistake of his life.\n\nWindows:\nWindows is made by Microsoft and was first released in 1975. Microsoft was created when Bill Gates and his friend Paul Allen were inspired by a magazine called Popular Electronics. Bill at the time was at Harvard and Paul was in Washington State University. The name Microsoft was created by Paul, combining the terms microcomputer and software. Microsoft was founded in New Mexico although in 1986 the company moved to Redmond Washington which is where the company headquaters is currently. Bill Gates and Paul Allen creating Microsoft had led them to create their first product which was a version of BASIC (programming language) for the Altair 8800 which was released in 1975",
                                  "Cost": "MacOS:\nApple products are generally more expensive. To use MacOS you would need a Mac computer from Apple unless you build a hackintosh. Currently the cheapest Mac from Apple is the Mac Mini at $699 at its lowest configuration. It would be cheaper to run Windows because although you can get prebuilt computers at relatively low prices, you could build your own computer to run Windows at very low prices. Although Mac are more expensive, with older Intel-based Macs you can use a built-in feature from Apple called bootcamp to partition your SSD to run Windows so you can get the best of both worlds.\n\nWindows:\nSince Microsoft only makes the operating system and leaves other manufacturers to make hardware for the operating system, there are way cheaper options for running Windows since you don't need to get Microsoft hardware like you do with MacOS and Apple. You could also build your own computer to run Microsoft as all you need is a product key to activate Windows which cost $120 for Windows 10 home edition. Therefore, it is cheaper to use Windows because all you need is to buy the product key to activate Windows. Apple is also notorious for their Apple tax where the hardware is worse than their counterparts at the same price.",
                                  "OS Family": "MacOS:\nMacOS is based on UNIX, more specifically the NeXT operating system and NeXT was a UNIX like operating system based on BSD although it was using the Mach microkernel (microkernel: near minimum amount of software needed to make an OS run). NeXT was founded by Steve Jobs when he left Apple in 1985 where he took a few Apple employees with him to start another company. Later Apple bought NeXT to replace their Macintosh operating system which needed a major update to utilise modern chips. When Apple bought NeXT, they upgraded and customised it. Over several decades of evolving their customised NeXT operating system, Apple released Mac OSX 10.0 in 2001 which started to resemble the MacOS that people are familiar to.\n\nWindows:\nMicrosoft made Windows as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS since there was a growing interest in graphical user interfaces (GUI). The first Windows operating system was released in 1985 and relied on a command line for input.\nWindows 2 was released 2 years later in 1987. In Windows 2, windows could overlap each other and can minimise or maximise windows. The control panel (system settings) was introduced as well as Word and Excel.\n3 years later, Windows 3 was released where 8 bit colour was now supported. A few years later Windows 3.1 was introduced where Minesweeper was released.\nWindows 95 which came out in 1995 and introduced the Start button and menu and the task bar. Internet Explorer was also released.\nSkipping a few Windows versions, in 2001, Windows XP was released which started to resemble the present day Windows 10. The iconic wall paper called Bliss which has a green hill and a blue sky with clouds was also in Windows XP.\nIn 2007, Windows Vista came out where Windows Media Player and Internet Explorer 7 was released. It also came with Windows Defender, DVD Maker, Photo Gallery and speech recognition although it faced many criticism.\n2 years later Windows 7 came out which fixed the problems in Windows Vista. It was faster and more stable and introduced more users into the Windows operating system. Many estimates conclude that about 20% of devices still run on Windows 7 in 2020.\nWindows 8 was introduced in 2012 where the start button and menu was ditched in order to cater for touch screen displays. Microsoft faced a lot of criticism so 1 year later they released Windows 8.1 where the start button and menu was brought back.\nMicrosoft's latest operating system Windows 10 was released in 2015. Windows 10 was designed to allow multiple devices including tablets and phones and computers to run on the same operating system. It is designed to run on computer tablets like the Surface Pro where it can be ran like a proper desktop operating system by using a keyboard and mouse but could also switch to a tablet. ",
                                  "Market Reach": "MacOS:\nMacOS is generally favoured by the creative crowd as well as developers. This can be because Macs are designed in a way and also heavily marketed as an operating system where everything just works and is simple to use for many. A lot of people believe that MacOS is made of people who are busy and need to get work done and they're not wrong. MacOS doesn't advertise games to you unlike Windows 10 does. MacOS also does not shove Safari down your throat like Windows does with Edge. If you prefer Chrome over Safari all you need to do is to switch it once in your System Preferences and that's it. On Windows, many users complain when the operating system keeps on recommending Edge. It is also understandable why the creatives like MacOS so much because out of the box you already have a basic video editor (iMovie) and a digital audio workstation (Garage Band) as well as Apple's free productivity suite called iWork. It has a presentation, word processing and spread sheet software without needing to download additional software. It may not be the best and it is quite basic but it gets the job done for many. You can also buy industry leading video editing and DAW software from Apple that are inclusive to MacOS like Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro however there are other options that are made for Windows such as Microsoft Office 365 and the Adobe Creative Suite that contain a bunch of productivity and graphic designing, video editing and web developer applications although these applications can also be accessed on MacOS. Since they can be accessed on MacOS, many people favour it as they have a larger range of options of applications to use.\n\nWindows:\nWindows although may not have the same benefits as MacOS, the majority of people use Windows as their main operating system. This is mainly because of the price tag. Since you can only use MacOS on a Mac computer from Apple unless you build a hackintosh or pay for a virtualisation service, you are stuck with paying high prices that many people cannot afford. Windows simply is the cheaper option that is as functional if not more functional. Another reason why is because of gaming. You can still game on MacOS but its just not designed for gaming. On the other hand, all gamers prefer Windows since you can customise your hardware which gives you the raw power to run high demand games while on a Mac you are stuck with whatever hardware Apple gives you. Since Windows is also used by more people, more games are supported on Windows.",
                                  "Design": "Navigation Bar:\n*The navigation bar on the Mac is known as the dock. In the dock you can store commonly used Apps, your downloads folder and your rubbish bin. You can also store your windows in the dock without closing the application by clicking the yellow button on the top left of the window. On Windows 10, the navigation bar contains commonly used apps, settings, time, date and more. It is also vertically shorter than the dock on a Mac which gives you more screen real estate although on MacOS you can adjust your dock size without going into the settings and automatically the more stuff you keep in the dock the smaller it will be to adjust for the amount of stuff. On both Windows and MacOS you can put the dock or navigation bar on the bottom, left or right for personal preference.\n\nApplication Launcher:\n* Both MacOS and Windows 10 have an Application Launcher. The app launcher on Windows 10 is limited to the start menu when you click the start button. The apps are organised into boxes of different sizes as well as other features like weather apps showing the weather without needing to go into the app. The app launcher on MacOS is cleaner and simpler and resembles iOS more. You can access the app launcher or launchpad as known on MacOS by clicking the launchpad icon on the dock or click F4 or if you have a trackpad, swipe 3 fingers and your thumb inwards. The launchpad will show you all the applications in your applications folder. The launchpad will take over the whole screen unlike Windows 10 but would allow you to see more Apps at once.\n\nStatus Bar:\n* The status bar is known as the menu bar on MacOS. It includes commonly used settings and information like your battery level, time, weather, a button for spotlight search etc. The status bar on Windows 10 is more or less the same as MacOS except that it is positioned in the bottom right of the screen in the navigation bar while the menu bar on MacOS is on the top right of the screen.\n\nVirtual Assistants:\n* In terms of virtual assistants, Siri and Cortana is roughly the same on functionality. Both include features to call on them. Siri will activate when you say 'Hey Siri' and you can configure Cortana to turn on in the settings menu. When you have everything configured, you just need to say 'Cortana'.",
                                  "Included Applications": "MacOS:\nApp Store, Automator, Books, Calculator, Calendar, Chess, Contacts, Dictionary, Face Time, Find My, Font Book, Garage Band, Home, iMovie, Keynote, Mail, Maps, Messages, Music, News, Notes, Numbers, Pages, Photo Booth, Photos, Podcasts, Preview, Reminders, Safari, Stickers, Stocks, TextEdit, TV, Voice Memos, Activity Monitor, Airport Utility, Audio MIDI Setup, Bluetooth File Exchange, Boot Camp Assistant, ColorSync Utility, Console, Digital Colour Meter, Disk Utility, DVD Player, Grapher, Image Capture, Keychain Access, Migration Assistant, QuickTime Player, Screenshot, Script Editor, System Information, Terminal, VoiceOver Utility\n\nWindows:\n3D Builder, Alarms & Clock, Calculator, Calendar, Camera, Cortana, Get Office , Get Skype (Microsoft Office and Skype is not included out of the box), Get Started, Groove Music, Mail, Maps, Microsoft Edge, Microsoft Solitaire Collection, Money, Movies & TV, News, OneNote, People, Phone Companion, Photos, Settings, Sports, Microsoft Store, Voice Recorder, Weather, Windows Feedback, Xbox",
                                  "Security and Reliabiltiy": "MacOS historically has been safer than Windows because less people use MacOS. Because of that, more malware is targeted to Windows users, making Windows more vulnerable to attacks which will make it less stable. However in the past few years, Mac targeted attacks are getting more frequent. MacOS is also more reliable because since only Macs can run MacOS, there is a very small product line that Apple needs to focus on for each release of MacOS while Microsoft has to cater for a lot more computers of differnent configurations. This makes it harder to provide a more stable operating system. Plus MacOS is less customisable than Windows. Although this limits your functionality, it also gives you a more reliable OS because less things can go wrong. Another reason why MacOS is better in terms of security is that I have realised that most casual Windows users are so conditioned into clicking every OK button they see that they will essentially click on anything without reading Windows security threats. Although this may not apply to everyone and may also apply to Mac users, I think MacOS does a better job at warning users since it alert users when they download anything from untrusted developers or unverified developers. Sometimes they even force users to manually go into the System Preferences App where they would need to type in their password or use Apple's biometric security known as Touch ID to open a file downloaded from the internet. I believe that this will educate users to not click on random links but also stop them from randomly clicking OK buttons whenever they see it. Another benefit of MacOS is that there are major updates annually that will improve the operating system's security. These are updates are free and you can update any Mac as long as they are compatible. Mac OS Big Sur (Latest version) still support Macs from 2013. Unlike MacOS, Microsoft wants you to buy the next version of Windows instead of giving it to the user for free. This has caused disasters like the Wanna Cry incident where the ransomware Wanna Cry targeted people using outdated Windows operating systems. This affected many organisations and companies like the NHS, Boeing, FedEx etc. ",
                                  "Gaming": "There is no doubt that Windows is the clear winner when it comes to gaming since Macs fundamentally are just not designed for gaming. Most Macs just simply do not have the raw power to run modern AAA games although Macs are more optimised since there is less hardware using MacOS. Windows is also better for gaming because there isn't a lot of games are supported for MacOS, mainly because less people use MacOS and very little people buy a Mac specifically just for gaming. Most people buy Macs for productivity although some play games occasionally. Although there isn't a lot of games for Mac, Mac users can bootcamp their computer to run Windows and game from there. There will be one major problem though and that is Macs are not known to have the best GPUs. In order to run AAA titles you would probably need to buy an eGPU (external Graphics Processing Unit). Another downside to gaming on a Mac is that Nvidia and Apple aren't really friendly to each other. Apple used to work closely with Nvidia until 2008 but Apple abandoned Nvidia since then. Apple then turned to AMD even though Nvidia was more popular and normally has better performance. Windows are also better for gaming because most people game on a Tower PC. This allows people to easily upgrade hardware while people using Macs could only dream about upgrading their specs. Apple in the past decade slowly removed Mac user's ability to upgrade their hardware. Apple also doesn't like users messing around and customising their Macs so they designed it in a way that is hard to tear down and repair.",
                                  "Ecosystem": "MacOS:\nOne of the best features about MacOS is the seamless integration within the Apple Ecosystem. Everything just simply works. Want to copy and paste something from your iPhone to your Mac, just do it, want to open your Safari Tabs from your Mac on an iPad, its a couple clicks away, want to use your iPad as an external monitor for your Mac, Apple implemented a feature called Sidecar which allows you to extend your Mac display onto an iPad. You can call and receive messages and phone calls on your Mac or iPad or Apple Watch. Everything just simply works and is in sync. Not to mention AirDrop which is plain amazing. These features are just the tip of the iceberg, there are still many other features like AirPlay which uses WiFi to extend your display onto a TV. Plus everything is just synced (Notes, contacts, search history etc). Apple worked very hard on their ecosystem to make a seamless user experience and they certainly hit the nail on the head. \n\nWindows:\nCurrently Windows may not match Apple's ecosystem, but they do work well with Android devices. Now, you can sync reminders and calendar events between your PC and Android device. Microsoft Office 365 also works well with Android devices since it can take photos on an Android device and transfer it to a Windows 10 PC using Office Lens. Although there isn't really an ecosystem for Windows 10 (there is Android integration though), it is understandable since a lot of computers use Windows 10, it is hard to make an ecosystem that works for everyone. ",
                                  "Hardware": "MacOS:\nUnfortunately, you can only use MacOS if you have a Mac computer from Apple. Some people still use MacOS by making a Hackintosh. Hackintosh is just a name given for non-Apple computers running MacOS. According to Apple's licensing terms it is illegal to use a hackintosh.\n\nWindows:\nUnlike Apple, you can use Windows on basically most computers since the Microsoft gives manufacturers the freedom of running their operating system. Therefore many tech hardware companies like Asus, Dell, Razer and more run Windows. Plus you can run Windows on a Mac. If you have an Intel based Mac, your Mac will allow you to run Windows natively through bootcamp. Bootcamp is just an utility software by Apple that helps Mac users install Windows. Intel based Macs fundamentally are just a x86 based computer with some sort of CPU and the same sort of RAM and graphics cards and SSD and I/O ports. There's nothing stopping Intel based Macs from running Windows. If you have a new Arm based Mac you could not run Windows natively but you can virtualise Windows with third party software like Parallels. You may not be able to play games at high settings with virtualisation but if you just need to run Word, virtualisation is enough."
